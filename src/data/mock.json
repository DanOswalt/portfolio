The old process was to print a report once per day. With this live window into the holds queue, we could fetch them as they arrived. A desktop app for our front-desk computers made the most sense, so I designed and developed this in Electron.js with Vue.js on the front-end. I animated our owl logo SVG with a JS library called Velocity.js (which you only get to see if you clear the queue).",
